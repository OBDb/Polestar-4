    description: "The Polestar 4 represents the brand's first SUV coupe, slotting between the Polestar 2 fastback and Polestar 3 SUV in size while focusing on aerodynamic performance and design distinctiveness. Built on Geely's SEA (Sustainable Experience Architecture) platform, it features a dramatically sloping roofline culminating in a full-width rear light bar, muscular proportions with a cab-forward stance, and Polestar's minimalist Scandinavian design language. Most notably, the Polestar 4 eliminates the traditional rear window entirely, relying instead on a high-definition rear camera system feeding a digital rear-view mirrorâ€”a radical design choice prioritizing aerodynamics and styling over conventional visibility. Available in single-motor rear-wheel drive configuration producing 272 horsepower or dual-motor all-wheel drive with 544 horsepower and 506 lb-ft of torque, the latter capable of 0-62 mph acceleration in 3.8 seconds. Both variants utilize a 94 kWh (usable) battery providing approximately 300-340 miles of range depending on configuration, with 200 kW DC fast-charging capability allowing a 10-80% charge in less than 30 minutes. The futuristic interior features a minimalist design with a 15.4-inch landscape-oriented central touchscreen complemented by a 10.2-inch driver display and an additional 14.7-inch display for front passengers in some markets. The absence of a rear window creates a unique full-length glass roof experience for rear passengers. Technology is powered by Android Automotive OS with Google services built-in, and advanced driver assistance is provided through a comprehensive sensor suite. Interior materials emphasize sustainability with animal-free options and recycled content. The Polestar 4 targets the growing premium electric SUV coupe segment pioneered by vehicles like the Tesla Model Y, combining distinctive design, performance-oriented driving dynamics, and cutting-edge technology in a package that further establishes Polestar's unique brand identity in the evolving electric vehicle marketplace."
